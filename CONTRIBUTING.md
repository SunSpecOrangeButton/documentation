# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Orange Button Documentation.  Great projects require great documentation.

The documentation in this repository should holistically describe the Orange Button open source projects at a high level.  Documentation specific to a particular repository should be placed in the individual repositories and linked from here.

# Ground Rules
Responsibilities

* Ensure that documentation contributed is professional and well written.  New Orange Button users first impression of the project will be this documentation and they are much more likely to become users or contributors if the documentation is great.
* Respect all community members at all times.

# Getting started
You must sign the Orange Button Indiviudal or Corporate Contributors agreement before enhancing or changing the documentation.

There is no formal process for working on the documentation itself.  Documentation can be added without pull requests or pull requests may be used if preferred.

Please send an email to support@sunspec.org so we are aware of your intent to contribute.  Optionally its ok ask for a review of changes in advance although this is not strictly required.

# How to report inaccurate or incomplete documentation
